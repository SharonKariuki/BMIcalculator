                            In a small bowl, whisk vinegar, chili sauce, lime juice, and salt. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
                            
                            Make Ahead: Vinaigrette can be made 1 week ahead. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate.
                            PEANUT SAUCE
                            
                            In a medium bowl, whisk peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, chili sauce, ginger, oil, and garlic until smooth. Whisk in 1 tablespoon cold water to combine; if sauce is still too thick, add more cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until a smooth, pourable consistency is reached. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 
                            
                            Make Ahead: Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate.
                            SALAD
                          
                            Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°. In a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil.
                           
                            Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt. Add to pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and cook on second side until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more.
                           
                            Transfer skillet to oven and roast until chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160°, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Cut into 1/4" strips.
                            
                            Meanwhile, in another medium skillet over medium heat, toast almonds, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. 
                           
                            In same skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Add carrot and cook, tossing occasionally, until tender and blistered on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes; season with salt. Transfer to a medium heatproof bowl.
                            
                            In same skillet over medium heat, cook bell pepper, tossing occasionally, until blistered, 2 to 3 minutes; season with salt. Transfer to bowl with carrots. 
                            
                            In same skillet over medium heat, cook edamame, tossing occasionally, until blistered, 1 to 2 minutes; season with salt. Add to bowl with carrots and peppers. 
                           
                            In a large bowl, toss romaine and cilantro with vinaigrette. Divide among bowls and top with vegetables and chicken. Drizzle with peanut sauce. Top with almonds and wonton strips.
                           
                            Make Ahead: Chicken and vegetables can be cooked 3 days ahead. Let cool, then store in separate airtight containers and refrigerate.
